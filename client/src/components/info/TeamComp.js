                <h5>Editorial Board Information</h5>
                <p className="large12 small12">
                    Members of the Editorial Board, which is international, are appointed by the Advisory Board of the IJLE. The composition of the Board is such that there is a wide range of expert opinion covering most areas of research in Law and Social science.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The Editors are supported by an international panel of Editorial Advisers. These are independent reviewers, who are expert each in their own specific field of Law and Social Science and who review paper for the journal. The close association of the Advisers with the journal means that a high standard of reviewing can be maintained.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Editors of review normally serve for a period of 3 years, although this may be extended for a further 4 years in some cases. The composition of the Advisory Panel is reviewed each year. The names of the members of the Editorial Board, Advisory Board and Editor Review Committee Members are published on the Journal’s website.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Authors may suggest potential reviewers for their paper in the letter of submission, but the journal will usually regard such suggestions as a guide only and is under no obligation to follow them. Authors may also specify the names of those they wish to be excluded from the review process for a particular paper; in such cases their wishes are usually respected, unless, of course, in the opinion of the journal such a request unreasonably excludes all the expertise available to it in that legal area.
                    <br/><br/>
